The Russian authorities deny that these people are Russian servicemen who invaded Ukraine and describe them as "local self-defense forces" dressed in an army uniform. Nevertheless, many facts, including direct interviews with several soldiers, indicate that these are Russian troops. These armed people surrounded numerous Ukrainian military targets, blocking visits and establishing checkpoints on all roads in the region.
