 civ_casualties.1.t:0 "Sensational article"
 civ_casualties.1.d:0 "Breaking news from the war zone. Our journalists got hold of reports about the massacre of civilians by our soldiers. According to reports, fighters from one of the regular army units completely cut out several settlements in the territory occupied by the troops. According to preliminary estimates, the number of victims is about several tens of thousands of people. At a press conference convened for the participation of the heads of all law enforcement agencies, the following statement was made: "All reports of some kind of" reprisals "of our soldiers over the civilian population are a monstrous slander and provocation. Our intelligence had intelligence information that the enemy was going to kill two birds with one stone - retreating, shoot all disloyal elements, leave the bodies to our advancing troops in order to accuse us of war crimes and denigrate us in the eyes of the world community. " Of course, very few people took this statement on faith. It is obvious that now our country will come under the most severe influence of the UN, however, how this will affect the ruling elite is an open question."

So far, several dozen civilian casualties have been confirmed. A spokesman for the Ministry of Defense said the following: “The tragic incident with shelling of a peaceful village, which happened recently, provoked by an enemy sabotage group, which meanly hiding behind civilians, fired at our patrol and was destroyed by return fire. Yes, several civilians were killed, but this is a war, losses here are inevitable, especially since the blame for the death of these people will fall entirely on the conscience of the Urzykstan military clique, which is an additional proof of their barbaric nature."
