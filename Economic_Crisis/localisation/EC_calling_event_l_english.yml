 calling_wave.1.t:0 "Growing discontent with the military draft"
 calling_wave.1.d:0 "Because of the prolonged fighting, which is taking more and more victims, fewer people want to go to die for our country. The ever-expanding appeal is causing more and more resistance in society. While this discontent has a small scale, however, maybe it makes sense to play it safe and slightly reduce the scale of the draft campaign, until the situation is out of control?"
 calling_wave.1.a:0 "Yes, we need to review the recruitment strategy"
 calling_wave.1.b:0 "Let everything remain as it was..."

 calling_wave.2.t:0 "Formation of the anti-war movement"
 calling_wave.2.d:0 "As hopes for an early end to the war weren't fulfilled, and the loss of life was too great, a well-organized broad anti-war movement was formed in the society. A mass anti-war rally is being held in the capital, and various slogans are being heard-calls for mass draft evasion, demands to immediately sit down at the negotiating table with the enemy, and demands for the government to resign immediately. Taking into account the growing support for anti-war protests, it is necessary to find an effective solution to this problem, otherwise the situation threatens to get out of control and turn into big problems for us."
 calling_wave.2.a:0 "If we expose these troublemakers as foreign spies, it will split their movement."

 calling_wave.3.d:0 ""...in the current circumstances, pacifist and anti-war slogans are becoming more widespread in society, cases of draft evasion are becoming more frequent, and various opposition politicians are trying to play on the wave of popular discontent. Citizens who were previously identified as possible foreign agents by the security services were also seen inciting anti-war sentiment. Cases of moral decay, desertion, and disobedience to orders of officers became more frequent in the troops...""
 calling_wave.3.a:0 "We need to radically solve this problem, the existence of our country is at stake!"
 calling_wave.3.b:0 "Let the counterintelligence service deal closely with this "movement"..."
 calling_wave.3.c:0 "We must try to convince the pacifists of our support..."
 
 emigration_war.1.t:0 "The flight of the population"
 emigration_war.1.d:0 "Not wanting to give their lives for our country, succumbing to defeatist moods, our population began to go abroad EN masse, in search of a peaceful life. The biggest problem is the fact that most of the fugitives are citizens fit for military service. If we do not stop this problem immediately, we will be left without manpower and will certainly be defeated not only on the military front but also on the economic one..."
