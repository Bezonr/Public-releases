### Scripting Department

 - Redesigned the mobilization system

> The mobilization system was a good idea for implementing the wave appeal, however, it was made quite raw, now we have revised it for the sake of even more realism.
> We decided to choose 44% of the percentage of conscripts as the basis, but why?
> And the fact is that the population in HOI4 is only a figure, there is no division into segments of the population, for example, gender, disability, age, which means that if you set 100% of the population in a certain Andorra whose population is only 85,100 people, you will get in the army absolutely the same number of conscripts, I think you will agree that this situation is quite delusional. Of course, in the original game, you can mobilize no more than half of the country's population, but not everyone can serve, so we decided that it is necessary to take into account different segments of the population, for example, gender, civil servants, prisoners, disabled people, pensioners, students, children, etc., etc. Thus, now we and the developers of submods have more ways to implement ideas and clarify the realities of the state.

# 0.7.6.3

### Scripting Department

- The EAEU has been reworked.

According to our idea, the EEU is a more centrist alliance than the EU, however, in the past, the EEU was considered as a kind of USSR 2.0 with a stupid imitation of its neighbors.

Now, the EEU is the economic union that it should be.

Specifically for the EEU, it was necessary to develop a kind of system of supranational unions.

> Similarity because, according to the developer himself, it does not reach the title of the system.

26 tricks were developed instead of 4. However, in addition to their increase, these focuses are available for all countries that may be the EEU, however, they will appear only after joining the EEU.

We have developed a lot of solutions specifically for the EEU, at the moment, their number is 36 pieces.

With the development of the EAEU, the capabilities of the union itself will expand. However, it should be borne in mind that it will not be very cheap. You will need a huge amount of money.

However, all members of the EEU will be able to explore different focuses and thus invest in the EEU.

The Eurasian Fund, also known as the Eurasian Bank in further development, will serve as the general budget of the EAEU, as well as the possibility of financing all-Union infrastructure projects.

However, if you fail to fulfill your membership obligations, you may be excluded from the EEU, along with this you will lose all the effects and investments.

Initially, the EEU bank will not be available, but everything is understood with development.

The EEU will expand freely, unlike the EU. The leader of the EAEU will make the decision on joining.

Also, the leadership of the EAEU will be transferred every year between all its members.

The EEU also has its own diplomacy in development from the participating countries.

Also, the branch is a unique phenomenon of using all the features of HOI for technologies. Unfortunately, I have not seen such a large-scale study in any project. © Secretary of the CPSU

Previously, due to the overall complexity of the work, the game could not correctly display the modifiers. In this update, this was improved, however, all the currently visible parameters worked before and significantly played out on the player.

The form for a certain type of terrain provided quite significant bonuses, however, for other regions, such a form will do more harm than good, as this text signals.

However, do not be afraid, it will not disappear anywhere.
